Industrial Automation and Political Polarization

Abstract:

Has increased industrial automation contributed to the widening political divide? In this paper we explore the impact of industrial automation on political outcomes and polarization in the United States from the early 1990s to 2016. In particular, we attempt to estimate the causal effect of the change in the stock of industrial robots on both congressional elections, and presidential elections, as well as the ideological positions of members elected to the House of Representatives. We accomplish this using the change in the national stock of industrial robots for fifteen broad industries and the composition of employment in local labor markets to construct a Bartik-like instrument referred to in this paper as exposure to robots. Our re- sults suggest that commuting zones with high levels of exposure to industrial roboticization saw increases in political competition that align with polarization, with our most clear results between the 2011-2016 period. We also find that their support for the more liberal party eroded over the period observed, culminating in their increased support for the Republican nominee for President between the 2008 and 2016 election cycles. However, we find no measurable effect between our measure of industrial automation and political polarization for members elected to the House of Representatives.
